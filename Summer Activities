Summer Activties

    Over the summer, I took 2 online classes: Web Programming and American Sign Language 2. I enjoyed them both :)

    Over the summer, for the most part, I spent time with my family. At the beginning of the summer, I got to go 
    on a family trip to Tennessee. There were moments during the trip that went a little chaotic, but overall it 
    was a fun trip. Towards the end of the summer, I also got to go on another trip to Minnesota. I also took some 
    time to plant and grow peppers, as I have been doing for the past few summers. Only this year, I chose to go 
    for more spicy peppers this year. I planted Carolina reapers, ghost peppers, scorpion Trinidad, some purple 
    cayenne, etc. I have this goal when growing peppers, to eat one of each kind of pepper. I idiotically chose to 
    eat the Carolina reaper for the first time just before we left to head back home from our trip to Minnesota. 
    Looking back at that now, I must say that that was a horrible decision, but interesting experience-wise. 
    Overall, it was one of the best summers I have had.
