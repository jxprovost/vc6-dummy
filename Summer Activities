Summer Activties

    Over the summer, I took 2 online classes: Web Programming and American Sign Language 2. I enjoyed them both :)

    Over the summer, for the most part, I spent time with my family. At the beginning of the summer, I got to go on 
    a family trip to Tennessee. There were moments during the trip that went a little chaotic, but overall it was a 
    fun trip. Towards the end of the summer, I also got to go on another trip to Minnesota. I also took some time to 
    plant and grow peppers, as I have been doing for the past few summers. Only this year, I chose to go for more 
    spicy peppers this year. I planted Carolina reapers, ghost peppers, scorpion Trinidad, some purple cayenne, etc. 
    I have this goal when growing peppers, to eat one of each kind of pepper. I idiotically chose to eat the Carolina 
    reaper for the first time just before we left to head back home from our trip to Minnesota. Looking back at that 
    now, I must say that that was a horrible decision, but interesting experience-wise. Overall, it was one of the 
    best summers I have had.

    I was enrolled in three summer classes, Natural Lanscape for Storytellers from Ball State, and Psych 101 and Public speaking from Ivy Tech.
    Other than that I just chilled out and built a new desktop computer. I'm currently very pleased with how it turned out, of course the issue is consistantly running into things 
    I need to download again for software development haha.
